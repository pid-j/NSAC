The NSAC (aka NewSereneAccess) protocol is a Python-based protocol.

## Requirements

If you want to host a server with `NSACServer.py`, you will require:
Python, Tkinter, requests, http.server, and urllib.

**KEEP IN MIND THAT http.server IS INSECURE!**

On the other hand, you can browse the web with `NSACBrowser.py` requiring:
Python, PyQt5, PyQtWebEngine, and requests.

## Usage

Download `NSACServer.py` if you want to host a server.
Download `NSACBrowser.py` if you want to browse the web.

Keep in mind that there are requirements.
